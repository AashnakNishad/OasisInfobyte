# OasisInfobyte

In this internship in the field of Data Science with Oasis Infobyte, I aim at displaying my relevant skills along with learning through completing different tasks assigned.

1) Task One
The first task assigned was to classify different species of a flower named IRIS, such as Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, which differ according to their measurements. I
implemented a Logistic Regression model and a Decision Tree model.
I also used one-hot encoding to convert target values from string to numeric data types for efficient prediction.

2) Task Two
The second task assigned was to analyze the unemployment rate in India. I used data visualization techniques such as pie chart and heat maps for the same.

3) Task Three
The third task assigned was to predict the selling price of cars based on various feature sets.
I used a Random Forest Regressor model to make these predictions and evaluated the model using the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) as the evaluation criterion.
Additionally, I employed one-hot encoding to convert string data types to numerical data types for better model performance.

4) Task Four
The fourth task assigned was identifying whether an email is spam or ham.
I used a Logistic Regression model for this classification task. To transform the text data into numerical data, I used the TfidfVectorizer library, which helped the machine better understand and predict the content of the emails.
